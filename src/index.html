            For more than ten years, the main area of ​​my activity is individual excursions in Tenerife.
            Embodying my dream in professional high-level work, I open the island from an entirely different angle,
            hidden from the eyes of ordinary tourists! VIP - people with whom I have gained a lot of experience,
            offer private tours in Tenerife on premium cars, as well as transfers from all airports of the island.
            In addition, I will be happy to help you organize and conduct individual tours in
            Tenerife and other Canary Islands, which deserve special attention. Each individual
            excursion is carried out on a new business-class car.</p></div>

        <div class="block-info"> <img src="../img/02.14.12.03-32_166.jpg"><h2>Sightseeing tour of Tenerife</h2>
    <p>Leaving the limits of the hotel, we are heading for the west coast of the island. Our route will run through the mountain serpentine, cross the various climatic zones, until we reach the small settlement of Santiago del Teide. It was this town that witnessed the last volcanic eruption in Tenerife in 1909. Well, as we will be in this area, we will definitely visit one of the most popular viewing platforms of the island with a view to the unique in its beauty, the Mask gorge. Next we will visit Garachico - one of the most colorful and charming towns of the island, whose sights are surprisingly preserved after the eruption of Trebeho volcano in 1706. Despite the fact that part of the town was buried under lava, its historical center and ancient narrow streets still delight tourists.

    <div class="block-info"> <img src="../img/6.jpg"><h2>Excursion to the volcano of Teide</h2>
        <p>The beginning of this amazing excursion will take place along the mountain serpentine with breathtaking observation platforms - after all the clouds will soon be under us! After passing several climatic zones en route to the Teide volcano, we will reach the highest mountain wine region of Spain with lush vineyards, where you can, if you want, get acquainted with the best Canarian wines. Already from there we will go to the settlement-record-holder Vilyaflor, which is the highest mountain village in Spain. He became famous for being the birthplace of one of the two Canarian saints, canonized by the Vatican, and the fact that the oldest and largest pine of the archipelago is growing near the village, which we will certainly stop to admire its grandiose look. And having overcome a peculiar subtropical zone, passing through the mountainous terrain, we will get to the National Park Las Cañadas del Teide, which has been under the auspices of UNESCO since 2007 as a World Heritage Site.

        <p>Russian excursions to Tenerife in the Mask valley traditionally begin from the west coast of the island, whose attractions are mountain serpentines and the village of Santiago del Teide, which saw the last volcanic eruption on the island in 1909. Next we head to one of the most charming and striking places - the Mask Gorge. This part of the island of Tenerife is hidden from the eyes of travelers by the veil of the mountains of Teno. In the gorge there is a very lively fauna and a variety of vegetation. At the same time, the descent by car to the village of Mask is a continuous adrenaline, because of deep ravines, closed turns and narrow roads, on which two cars can hardly be missed, tourists called this part of the road "6 km of fear".
