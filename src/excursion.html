    <div class="block-info"><h2>Sightseeing tour of Tenerife</h2><p>Leaving the limits of the hotel, we are heading for the west coast of the island. Our route will run through the mountain serpentine, cross the various climatic zones, until we reach the small settlement of Santiago del Teide. It was this town that witnessed the last volcanic eruption in Tenerife in 1909. Well, as we will be in this area, we will definitely visit one of the most popular viewing platforms of the island with a view to the unique in its beauty, the Mask gorge. Next we will visit Garachico - one of the most colorful and charming towns of the island, whose sights are surprisingly preserved after the eruption of Trebeho volcano in 1706. Despite the fact that part of the town was buried under lava, its historical center and ancient narrow streets still delight tourists.</p>
        <p>  Excursions in Tenerife can not be imagined without a thousand-year-old tree, which became a symbol of the island. This unique dracaena grows in the city of Icod de los Vinos, where travelers will have the opportunity to taste the best wines and local cheeses. The next point on our excursion map, after such a long journey, will be lunch in the once functioning monastery. In it you will find a restaurant for every taste: from fish to meat.</p>

       <p> After lunch, we will continue our journey and soon find ourselves in the architectural gem of the island - La Orotava, we seem to be transported in time for several centuries during the conquistadors and feudal lords. Well, the final point of our tour will be Candelaria, this place includes in its program every guide on the Canary Islands, as a must-see, because this is a pilgrimage center on the archipelago. In the center of the village is a square with statues of nine kings of Guanche, as if guarding the cathedral, which contains the main shrine of the archipelago - a statue of the dark-eyed Mother of God Candelar.</p>
